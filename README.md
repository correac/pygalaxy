pygalaxy
=======

[pygalaxy](https://github.com/correac/pygalaxy) is an analytic formalism
based on Correa et al. 2018a,b to calculate the best fitting expression
of hot halo gas heating & cooling rates, gas mass histories, hot gas fractions.

Written in python, it uses routines in numpy and scipy to create a structured dataset.

Note that pygalaxy assumes halo virial mass (M200) is 200 times critical overdensity, and
concentration is the ratio of halo virial mass (R200) over scale radius (obtained from best-fit NFW profile)

### Getting started
